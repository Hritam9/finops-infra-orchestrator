# Cost Optimization Report – Intelligent FinOps Infrastructure Orchestrator

## 1️⃣ Objective
Evaluate cost savings achieved by predictive right-sizing of Azure compute capacity.

---

## 2️⃣ Baseline

| Metric | Before Automation |
|---------|-------------------|
| Average VMSS Instances | 8 |
| Average CPU Utilization | 40% |
| Monthly Cost (est.) | \$1,200 |

---

## 3️⃣ After Implementation

| Metric | After Automation |
|---------|------------------|
| Average VMSS Instances | 5 |
| Average CPU Utilization | 70% |
| Monthly Cost (est.) | \$840 |
